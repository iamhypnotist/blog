I have a favorite Telegram chat with my university friends where we discuss football every day. And we have one topic that never fails to spark heated debates - Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi.

Recently, while browsing online for new and interesting ways to analyze the game, I came across the website [understat.com](https://understat.com). To my surprise, the site offered advanced analytics for the top 5 championships and for all players over the past 10 seasons.

Being an avid learner of the R programming language, specifically in the areas of visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), I couldn't resist the opportunity to dive into this data and see what insights I could gain.

To share my findings with others, I created a notebook in Google Colab that can be accessed here: [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a7EyHOB5QXB_sUr7oN382d_GrCxsAf_0?usp=sharing) . For those who are not familiar with notebooks, I wanted to give a couple of tips on how to navigate and view the notebook:

- To view the plots and charts, you will need to run the command "Runtime - Run all".
- To easily navigate through the notebook, you can use the table of contents located on the top left corner of the screen.

The results of my analysis, while not groundbreaking, provided a deeper understanding of the performance of Ronaldo and Messi over the last 10 seasons. I found that while both players are incredibly talented goal scorers, Messi has consistently been the more creative player, with a higher likelihood of making assists for his partners. On the other hand, Ronaldo is more focused on scoring goals.

It's worth noting that both players have been showing signs of deterioration in their overall performance in recent years, but their contributions to the game and their teams have been undeniable, and their legacies will continue to be a benchmark for future players.

Overall, this experience has been a great reminder of the power of data analytics in understanding and appreciating the game of football. I hope that others will also find this information interesting and useful.
