In the realm of software engineering, I find myself on a quest to rekindle my passion and unlock the superpower of focus.

Recently, I've become aware of the excessive time I spend glued to my phone, browsing websites I don't really need and lost in the depths of YouTube. Despite watching videos on software engineering, management, processes, and science, the information often slips away from memory. YouTube's algorithms are extremely good and the never-ending stream of fascinating content has led to a lack of focus.

Determined to break this cycle, I've embarked on a digital detox, limiting my phone usage to under an hour daily and blocking almost all notifications. Instead, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters to me, delving into leetcoding challenges and reading books.

By curating the information I consume and nurturing my focus, I'm reclaiming my time and nurturing personal growth. This intentional approach allows me to deeply engage with subjects that resonate, making a lasting impact on my career.

This post serves as a snapshot of my current state of mind, capturing the journey as I rediscover my passion for software engineering and empower myself to have a meaningful impact.
