In the world of software engineering, I'm on a mission to sharpen my focus.

I've noticed excessive phone use, so I've cut it down to less than an hour a day and turned off most notifications. Now, I'm dedicated to coding challenges and reading.

Being selective in what I consume helps me regain time and grow personally. This approach allows me to delve deeply into my interests, making a significant impact on my career.

This post reflects my journey: enhancing my concentration in the software engineering field.
