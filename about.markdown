Hi there! My name is Roman and I'm an iOS engineer with over 11 years of experience. In addition to mobile app development, I have a strong interest in data analytics, statistics and decision intelligence.

I started this blog as a way to track my own learning progress and share my knowledge and experience with others in the field. While I'm primarily using this blog to document my personal journey, fight imposter syndrome, and overcome procrastination, I hope that my insights and experiences may also be helpful to other engineers.

I'm based in Bangkok and I enjoy living here. In my spare time, I'm a huge coffee enthusiast and can often be found trying out different brews and roasts. I'm also a fan of Borussia Dortmund and enjoy following their matches.

Thank you for stopping by and I hope you find something helpful on my blog.
